## Very much WIP  

The Train App System is a full stack MERN project utilizing the UK rail industry's Open Rail Data system to provide office and driver applications for a variety of purposes including:  

- Creating rotas for drivers and assigning scheduled services to them.
- Allowing the driver to view their rotas and services from their tablet.
- Clocking in and out of shifts and submitting information about any issues encountered.
- Providing up to date information to the driver about temporary works and restictions on any services they are operating.
